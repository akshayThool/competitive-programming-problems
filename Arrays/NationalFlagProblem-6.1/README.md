# The Dutch National Flag Problem

### Problem Statement

Write a Program that takes an array A and an index i into A, and rearranges the elements such that all elements less than A[i] (the "pivot") appear first, followed by elements equal to the pivot, followed by elements greater than the pivot.


### Brute Force Approach i.e O(n) Time Complexity & O(n) Space Complexity

In this approach we simply create another array of integers, this array of integer is filled with appropiate numbers in order. Like, all the numbers smaller than that of pivot is added first, then all the equal numbers and lastly all the greater numbers.

### Two pass Approach i.e O(n<sup>2</sup>) Time Complexity & O(1) Space Complexity
