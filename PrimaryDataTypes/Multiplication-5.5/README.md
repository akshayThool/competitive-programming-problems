# Multiplication

## Problem Statement

Sometimes the processors used in ultra low-power devices such as hearing aids do not have dedicated hardware for performing multiplication. A program that needs to perform multiplication must do so explicitly using lower-level primitives.

Write a program that multiplies two nonnegative integers. The only operators you are allowed to use are 
* assignment,
* the bitwise operators >, <, |, &, -, ^ and
* equality checks and Boolean combination thereof.

You may use loops and function that you write yourself. These constraints imply, for example, that you cannot use increment or decrement, or test if x < y.
_Hint_: Add using bitwise operations, multiply using shift-and-add.

### Bitwise Add

Let's first take a look at how addition takes place at the binary level and understand it before trying to do it with bitwise operators

<table>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <th><span style="font-weight:bold">carry</span></th>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>a = 25</th>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><span style="font-weight:bold">b = 14</span></th>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><span style="font-weight:bold">sum = 39</span></th>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Understanding truth table for addition

| A | B | carry | sum |
|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 |

That means for calculating carry one should use XOR operator and for finding carry AND operator.

### Bitwise Decrement

In order to decrement or subtract one from a number we need to simply add two operands generated by the number. First operand is the `(number << 1)` and second operand is `(~number)`. Addition of these two operands will generate decrement by one.
> return bitwiseAdd((x << 1), (~x));

### Multiply using Brute Force

Steps
1. Take any one `number` of the two operand passed to multiply and initialize a `sum` variable to zero.
2. Perform `while` on this `number` with condition that `it is not zero` i.e `while(number)`.
3. For every loop, add the `second number` to the `sum` variable and decrement the `first number`

e.g Multiply 5 x 4 means, `first number` being 5, add 4 to `sum` variable for 5 times i.e `sum = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4`
