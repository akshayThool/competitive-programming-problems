# Division

## Problem Statement

Given two positive integers, compute their qoutient using only addition, subtraction and shifting operators.

## Brute Force Approach

Steps
1. Initialize a `qoutient` variable to 0.
2. Perform `while` loop with condition that `divisor <= dividend`
3. In every `while` loop, subtract the value of `divisor` from `dividend` and increment the value of `qoutient`.
4. Return the value of `qoutients`.
